To install a params mod, first backup the Params.ini file which is at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Ski Park Tycoon\data\Params.ini". Next, download the mod. After that, you have to rename the downloaded file to Params.ini. Once you have done that, copy it into the data folder and replace the original Params file. Now all the maps running that mod will work. Do not try and run a map with a mod that it isn't supposed to go with or the map will break.
