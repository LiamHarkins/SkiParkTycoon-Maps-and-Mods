This is the No Surface mod for Ski Park Tycoon. This mod gets rid of the Platter and T-Bar lifts. It changes the speed of the Gondola, and adds in a Triple, High Speed Quad, and High Speed Six Pack chairlift. The Double chairlift is called Platter when selecting a lift to build, Triple is T-Bar, and Fixed Quad is Double. If you are unsure how to install, check on the file in the Mods folder.
